    ABSTRACT = {Watershed is a widespread technique for image segmentation. Many researchers apply the method implemented in open source libraries without a deep understanding of its characteristics and limitations. In the review, we describe benchmarking outcomes of six open-source marker-controlled watershed implementations for the segmentation of 2D and 3D images. Even though the considered solutions are based on the same algorithm by flooding having O(n)computational complexity, these implementations have significantly different performance. In addition, building of watershed lines grows processing time. High memory consumption is one more bottleneck for dealing with huge volumetric images. Sometimes, the usage of more optimal software is capable of mitigating the issues with the long processing time and insufficient memory space. We assume parallel processing is capable of overcoming the current limitations. However, the development of concurrent approaches for the watershed segmentation remains a challenging problem.},

abstract = {This paper presents the results of the first Challenge of ICDAR 2011 Robust Reading Competition. Challenge 1 is focused on the extraction of text from born-digital images, specifically from images found in Web pages and emails. The challenge was organized in terms of three tasks that look at different stages of the process: text localization, text segmentation and word recognition. In this paper we present the results of the challenge for all three tasks, and make an open call for continuous participation outside the context of ICDAR 2011.},
